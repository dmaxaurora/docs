title: "Data Freshness"
description: "How current is the data returned by each endpoint family"
---

## Overview

Data freshness varies by endpoint because each endpoint draws from a different upstream source. Every response includes a `meta.as_of` timestamp so you always know the age of the data you're working with.

## Freshness by endpoint

| Endpoint Family | Source | Freshness | Timestamp Field |
|----------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Merchants** | RiseCRM | Near real-time (< 15 min) | `meta.as_of` |
| **Pricing (TSYS)** | BigQuery | T+1 business day | `meta.as_of` |
| **Transactions** | BigQuery | T+1 business day | `meta.as_of` |
| **Gateway transactions** | NMI API | Near real-time (5-min cache) | `meta.as_of` |
| **Statements** | BigQuery + GCS | ~5 business days after month close | `available_at` |
| **Residuals** | BigQuery | ~5 business days after month close | `data_cutoff_at` |
| **Portfolio summary** | BigQuery | T+1, cached 15-min per org | `meta.as_of` |
| **AI insights** | Vertex AI + BigQuery | Same as residuals, cached 1 hour | `generated_at` |

## Understanding the timeline

**Near real-time** endpoints (Merchants, Gateway transactions) reflect changes within minutes. If you update a merchant in your CRM, the API will show the change shortly after.

**T+1** endpoints (Pricing, Transactions) are refreshed overnight. Data from Monday's transactions appears in the API on Tuesday morning.

**Month-close** endpoints (Statements, Residuals) depend on processor reporting cycles. Data for January typically becomes available in the first week of February.

## Checking freshness in code

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers).json()
as_of = datetime.fromisoformat(resp["meta"]["as_of"])
age = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - as_of

if age.total_seconds() > 86400:  # older than 24 hours
    print(f"Warning: data is {age.days} days old")
```

```javascript Node.js
const { meta } = await resp.json();
const asOf = new Date(meta.as_of);
const ageMs = Date.now() - asOf.getTime();
const ageHours = ageMs / (1000 * 60 * 60);

if (ageHours > 24) {
  console.warn(`Data is ${Math.floor(ageHours / 24)} days old`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Residual report status

Residual report endpoints include a `report_status` field that indicates completeness:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `final` | All data received and reconciled |
| `preliminary` | Data available but may be revised |
| `pending` | Report period not yet closed |
