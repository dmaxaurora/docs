## Overview

Each month, after your processor reports are finalized (~5 business days after month close), the residuals endpoints provide a complete breakdown of your payout. This guide walks through a full reconciliation workflow.

## Step 1: List available reports

Check which monthly reports are available:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
resp = requests.get(f"{BASE}/residuals/reports", headers=HEADERS).json()
for report in resp["data"]:
    print(f"{report['year']}-{report['month']:02d}: {report['status']}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -H "X-Partner-API-Key: pk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  "https://modulate.aurorapayments.net/api/partner/residuals/reports"
```

</CodeGroup>

Only process reports with status `final` for reconciliation. `preliminary` reports may still be revised.

## Step 2: Get the monthly summary

Pull high-level totals for a specific month:

```python
summary = requests.get(
    f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/2026/1/summary",
    headers=HEADERS
).json()["data"]

print(f"Volume:     ${summary['total_volume']}")
print(f"Merchants:  {summary['merchant_count']}")
print(f"Payout:     ${summary['total_payout']}")
```

## Step 3: Pull per-merchant breakdown

Page through the merchant-level detail:

```python
page = 1
merchants = []

while True:
    resp = requests.get(
        f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/2026/1/merchants",
        headers=HEADERS,
        params={"page": page, "page_size": 200}
    ).json()

    merchants.extend(resp["data"])

    if page >= resp["meta"]["pagination"]["total_pages"]:
        break
    page += 1

# Verify totals match summary
calculated_volume = sum(float(m["volume"]) for m in merchants)
print(f"Calculated volume: ${calculated_volume:.2f}")
```

## Step 4: Check adjustments and withholds

<CodeGroup>

```python Adjustments
adjustments = requests.get(
    f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/2026/1/adjustments",
    headers=HEADERS
).json()["data"]

for adj in adjustments:
    print(f"{adj['description']}: ${adj['amount']}")
```

```python Withholds
withholds = requests.get(
    f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/2026/1/withholds",
    headers=HEADERS
).json()["data"]

for wh in withholds:
    print(f"{wh['description']}: ${wh['amount']}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: Verify payout

```python
merchant_total = sum(float(m["payout"]) for m in merchants)
adjustment_total = sum(float(a["amount"]) for a in adjustments)
withhold_total = sum(float(w["amount"]) for w in withholds)

expected_payout = merchant_total + adjustment_total - withhold_total
actual_payout = float(summary["total_payout"])

diff = abs(expected_payout - actual_payout)
if diff < 0.01:
    print("Reconciliation passed")
else:
    print(f"Discrepancy: ${diff:.2f}")
```

## Step 6: Export for records

For large portfolios, use the async export to get a CSV:

```python
# Create export
export = requests.post(
    f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/2026/1/merchants/export",
    headers=HEADERS
).json()["data"]

export_id = export["export_id"]
```

Then poll and download — see the [Export Data](/guides/export-data) guide.

## Trend analysis

Use the trend endpoint to compare months:

```python
trend = requests.get(
    f"{BASE}/residuals/reports/trend",
    headers=HEADERS,
    params={"months": 6}
).json()["data"]

for month in trend:
    print(f"{month['period']}: ${month['total_payout']} ({month['merchant_count']} merchants)")
```
