## Key features

- **Consistent envelope** — Every response uses the same `data` / `meta` / `errors` shape
- **Pagination** — All list endpoints support `page` and `page_size` params
- **Incremental sync** — Use `updated_since` to fetch only changed records
- **Decimal money** — All monetary values are strings (`"1234.56"`) to avoid floating-point issues
- **Data freshness** — Every response includes `meta.as_of` so you know how current the data is
